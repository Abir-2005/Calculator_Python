Basic Arithmetic Calculator (Python)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements a simple, menu-driven calculator application in Python. The goal is to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including functions, user input handling, conditional logic (if/elif/else), and modular code design.

üü£ Project Breakdown:

  1Ô∏è‚É£main_calculator.py: Manages the user interface and application flow. It presents a menu of operations, takes numerical inputs from the user, and validates the operation choice before delegating the calculation.
  
  2Ô∏è‚É£Function_Calculator.py: Contains four distinct functions (add, subtract, multiply, division) that execute the core arithmetic logic.

üîµ Key Features:
  ‚úÖ Modular Design: Separates UI logic from calculation logic for cleaner, more reusable code.

  ‚úÖ Continuous Operation: Runs in a while loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

  ‚úÖInput Validation: Includes basic error handling for non-numeric inputs and safeguards against Division by Zero.
